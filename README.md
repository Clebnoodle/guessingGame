# Overview

This project is a simple guessing game. The user is asked to input a positive integer. A random number will be picked between 1 and the number input. The user will then guess numbers until they find the right one. With each wrong guess the user will be told if the number is too high or too low.

The purpose of writing this software was to learn the basics of rust such as data structures, input output, function parameters, and object structure.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with the rust-analyzer extension.

This program was written completely in rust with the following dependencies:
* [rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand)
* [text_io](https://crates.io/crates/text_io)

# Future Work

* Implement a generic sort function
